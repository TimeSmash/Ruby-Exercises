# Ruby-Exercises
Exercises I made for myself to test my Ruby knowledge. The goal of these exercises is to get them to work in some way--since I'm a student, the most optimal way may not be performed, but nonetheless works.

I hope this can serve as a resource for others beginning in Ruby! I'm very new to this, so forgive the rough format this will undoubedtly have as I build it.
